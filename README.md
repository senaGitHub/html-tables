## :bookmark_tabs:	Overview
This project presents a structured table displaying various planetary facts about our solar system, sourced from **NASA's Planetary Fact Sheet**. The table categorizes planets into different groups based on their characteristics and includes data such as **mass, diameter, density, gravity, temperature, and number of moons**.

## ✨ Features

🏷️ Structured Table Layout - Planets are grouped into Terrestrial, Jovian, Gas Giants, Ice Giants, and Dwarf Planets.

🎨 Colgroup Styling - Some columns are visually distinct using border styling.

🎭 Zebra Striping - Alternating row colors for better readability.

🔗 External References - Includes links to NASA and other sources for additional information.

## 🚀 How to Use

1️⃣ Open **index.html** in any modern web browser.

2️⃣ The table will display planetary data with clear categories and descriptions.

3️⃣ Hover over the table elements for better visual distinction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** - Structuring the data into a readable table format.

* **CSS3** - Enhancing table appearance with borders, colors, and responsive styles.
