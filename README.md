# üåç Planets Data Table

## Overview
This project presents a structured table displaying various planetary facts about our solar system, sourced from **NASA's Planetary Fact Sheet**. The table categorizes planets into different groups based on their characteristics and includes data such as **mass, diameter, density, gravity, temperature, and number of moons**.

## Features

- Structured Table Layout - Planets are grouped into Terrestrial, Jovian, Gas Giants, Ice Giants, and Dwarf Planets.

- Colgroup Styling - Some columns are visually distinct using border styling.

- Zebra Striping - Alternating row colors for better readability.

- Responsive Design - The table adapts to different screen sizes with a viewport meta tag.

- External References - Includes links to NASA and other sources for additional information.

## How to Use

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open **index.html** in any modern web browser.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The table will display planetary data with clear categories and descriptions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Hover over the table elements for better visual distinction.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** - Structuring the data into a readable table format.

* **CSS3** - Enhancing table appearance with borders, colors, and responsive styles.
